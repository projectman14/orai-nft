# CW721-Factory Cosmwasm Smart Contract

A simple CW721-factory contract is designed for the Oraichain testnet as part of the OSOD (Oraichain Season of Docs).

The CW721-factory contract requires a CW721-base contract and the NFT data to mint an NFT and generate a CW721 address for it. The CW721-base contract serves as the collection to which the minted NFT will belong.

To deploy the CW721-factory contract, the CW721-base contract must be deployed first.
